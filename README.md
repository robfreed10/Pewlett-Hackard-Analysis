# Overview of Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of the analysis with SQL was to help prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" within Pewlett Hackard. As the results will show, there were many employees retiring across different roles within the company. Also, this analysis will help prepare the company for who is eligible for the Mentorship Program. 

## Results
SQL allowed for quick, but thorough analysis of the employees at Pewlett Hackard. The roles at the company that experienced a large retirement age was Senior Engineers, which has 29,414 employees, and Senior Staff, which had 28,254 employees. Overall, there are 90,398 employees that are in the retirement age that has been established. Of the 90,398 employees in the "silver tsunami" classification, there are many employees that are eligible for the retirement age. 1,549 employees are eligble for the mentorship program. 

## Summary
More than 90,000 roles will need to be filled in the coming years thanks to the "silver tsunami" or the massive amount of employees that are eligible to retire. There are only 1,549 employees that are eligible to be entered into the mentorship program. With this, there are not enough mentors to help the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. It is beneficial to bring this issue to light to the managers at Pewlett Hackard as maybe more money can be invested into new employee training as well as continuing the mentorship program. Or perhaps, the mentors available may have to mentor multiple new hires.
